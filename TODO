For "shell":

    * Make it possible to pre-populate the temporary directory with the
      contents of an existing directory.

    * Allow for multiple concurrent "shell" sessions in the same
      temporary directory, possibly by giving the user the ablity to
      manually pick the working directory (which would not be deleted
      when exiting the session).

    * Allow for exiting the "shell" session without deleting the
      temporary directory.
