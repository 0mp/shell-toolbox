## Shell scripts

* `shell`:    Creates a shell for testing things in.

 Creates a "temporary interactive shell" with a temporary working
 directory (unless the `-d` flag is used to specify an existing
 directory) and clean environment.  The working directory is removed
 when the shell exits (unless the `-k` or `-d` flag was used).  Useful
 for testing things in an interactive environment other than your usual
 shell.

 See `man 1 shell` after installation.
