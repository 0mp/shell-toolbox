Shell scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* shell:    Creates a shell for testing things in.

    Creates a temporary shell with a temporary working directory.  The
    working directory is removed when the shell exits.  Useful for
    testing things in an interactive environment other than your usual
    shell.


* shevil:   Creates files and directories with (possibly)
            difficult-to-handle names in a temporary directory.

    This script requires ksh93 or bash.


* shtest:   Runs a command in all shells.

    Iterates over all installed shells and runs the same command in all
    of them, capturing and displaying the exit status and the output
    sent to all standard streams.  Useful for testing compatibility of
    shell constructs between shells.

    Adaption of idea from @terdon on the "Unix & Linux" StackExchange
    forum.
