# Shell scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* "shell":    Creates a shell for testing things in.

     This script is useful for testing things in an interactive
     environment other than your usual shell, or for testing things in a
     clean environment with automatic cleanup of any files left behind.

     Creates a "temporary interactive shell" with a temporary working
     directory (unless the "-d" flag is used to specify an existing
     directory) and clean environment.  The working directory is removed
     when the shell exits (unless the "-k" or "-d" flag was used).

     See `man 1 shell` after installation.
