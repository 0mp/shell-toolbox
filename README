Shell scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* shell:  Creates a shell for testing things in

    Creates a temporary shell with a temporary working directory.  The
    working directory is removed when the shell exits.  Useful for
    testing things in an interactive environment other than your usual
    shell.

* shtest: Runs a command in all shells

    Iterates over all installed shells and runs the same command in all
    of them, capturing and displaying the exit status and the output
    sent to all standard streams.  Useful for testing compatibility of
    shell constructs between shells.
